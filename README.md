     * **Note:** You may run into issues when installing gems. On OSX El Capitan, there is a new security function that prevents you from modifying system files called Rootless. If you install gems on /usr/local/bin there will be no problem because rootless doesn't affect this path. If you get this error then run the following command:
    ```
    sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin GEM_NAME_HERE
    ```
